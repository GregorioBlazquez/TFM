# Tourism Assistant – Master’s Thesis (TFM)

This project is the Master’s Thesis (TFM) of **Gregorio Blázquez Martínez**, developed for the **Máster Big Data, Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (2024–2025)** at the **Universidad Complutense de Madrid**.

The goal is to combine **predictive modeling**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **multi-agent orchestration** into a single platform that analyzes, explains, and forecasts **tourism trends in Spain**.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture (high level)

- **MCP Server** → Exposes tools, prompts, and resources (sub-servers: prediction API, RAG, reports).  
- **Client (multi-agent orchestrator)** → Connects to MCP server, coordinates agents, maintains session state and delivers final answers.  
- **Frontend** → Minimal chat interface (`api/client/chat.html`) for interacting with the assistant.  
- **Inspector** → Tool for visual debugging and protocol inspection.  
- **Data & Models** → INE FRONTUR (tourist flows) and EGATUR (expenditure) datasets; ARIMA, clustering and regression models.

## 🚀 Quick Start (developer)

1. Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv TFM_venv
source TFM_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the MCP server (development):
```bash
python -m mcp_code.servers.main_server
```

3. Run the client backend (development):
```bash
uvicorn api.client.backend_app:backend_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

4. Or start everything with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

For environment-specific setup and docker details, see `doc/02_setup.md` and `doc/06_deployment.md`.
